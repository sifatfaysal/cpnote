This program demonstrates the use of variables in C. Variables are used to store values in a program, and can be manipulated and used in calculations.

In this program, three variables are declared: 'a', 'b', and 'sum'. The first two lines assigns the value 5 and 7 to the variable 'a' and 'b' respectively.

The third line uses the assignment operator (=) to add the values of 'a' and 'b' and store the result in the variable 'sum'. The printf function is then used to print the values of 'a', 'b' and 'sum' to the console.

The core concept of the program is to demonstrate the use of variable in C. It assigns values to variable 'a' and 'b' and performs basic arithmetic operation of addition and store the result in variable 'sum' and finally print the value of 'a', 'b' and 'sum'
