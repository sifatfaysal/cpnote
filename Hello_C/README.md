    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main() {
        printf("Hello, World!");
        return 0;
    }


This is a basic "**Hello, World!**" program in C. It starts with the #include <stdio.h> statement, which includes the standard input/output library and allows the use of the printf() function.

The int main() statement indicates the start of the main code for the program. Inside the main function, the printf("Hello, World!"); statement is used to print the string "Hello, World!" to the console.

The return 0; statement at the end of the main function signifies that the program has completed successfully and returns an exit code of 0 to the operating system.
